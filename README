Node.js Boilerplate
===========================================================

I found myself constantly needing a boilerplate that included:
- Express
- Jade
- Stylus
- Nib
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Socket.io

So I put a very basic repo together that includes just those essentials.  I hope that others find this useful.

I also included a "flushdb" batch file which will clear all the data out of the data/db folder, as well as a "launch" batch file that will run mongo and nodemon.

Notes: 
- This requires Node.js, Nodemon and MongoDB to be installed before hand.
- To install dependences run "npm install" from the root directory
